# NLP-tagging-prediction-using-HMM

Part-of-Speech tagging involves predicting the class of a word in the context of a sentence, for example. This project involves the use of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to predict the class of a word given transition and emission probabilities. Many different variations of the HMM was explored to finetune the algorithm to produce the highest testing accuracy.
